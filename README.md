# Company Layoffs: Data Cleaning
## Project Overview

Layoff Data Cleaner is a comprehensive data cleaning project aimed at organizing and preparing a dataset of global company layoffs for analysis. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides detailed information on company layoffs in 2022. You can find the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022


## Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following features:

1. company: The name of the company that experienced layoffs.
2. location: The location of the company's headquarters.
3. industry: The industry sector in which the company operates.
4. total_laid_off: The total number of employees laid off.
5. percentage_laid_off: The percentage of the workforce that was laid off.
6. date: The date when the layoffs were announced.
7. stage: The funding stage of the company (e.g., Post IPO, Stage A, Stage B, Series ABC).
8. country: The country where the company is located.
9. funds_raised_millions: The total funds raised by the company in millions of dollars.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:

- Clean the Data: Handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and standardize formats.
- Prepare for Analysis: Structure the data in a way that is suitable for analysis and visualization.
- Ensure Accuracy: Verify the accuracy of the data through validation checks.

## Methodology
The data cleaning process involves the following steps:

- Data Import: Load the dataset from the CSV file.
- Data Inspection: Examine the data to understand its structure and identify any issues.
- Handling Missing Values: Address any missing or null values in the dataset.
- Data Standardization: Ensure consistency in data formats, such as date and numerical values.
- Data Validation: Perform checks to validate the accuracy and integrity of the data.
- Export Cleaned Data: Save the cleaned dataset for further analysis.
By following these steps, Layoff Data Cleaner transforms the raw dataset into a cleaned and well-structured format, ready for various analytical tasks such as trend analysis, visualization, and reporting.

## Benefits
Using Layoff Data Cleaner provides several benefits:

- Improved Data Quality: Ensures that the dataset is free from errors and inconsistencies.
- Enhanced Usability: Makes the data easier to use for analysis and decision-making.
- Time Savings: Automates the data cleaning process, saving time and effort for data analysts and researchers.
