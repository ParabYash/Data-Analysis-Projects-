# Company Layoffs: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis
## Project Overview

Layoff Data Cleaner and Explorer is a comprehensive project aimed at organizing, preparing, and analyzing a dataset of global company layoffs for 2022. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides detailed information on company layoffs. You can find the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022

The project consists of two main parts:

1. Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the cleaned dataset to uncover trends and insights.


## Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following features:

1. company: The name of the company that experienced layoffs.
2. location: The location of the company's headquarters.
3. industry: The industry sector in which the company operates.
4. total_laid_off: The total number of employees laid off.
5. percentage_laid_off: The percentage of the workforce that was laid off.
6. date: The date when the layoffs were announced.
7. stage: The funding stage of the company (e.g., Post IPO, Stage A, Stage B, Series ABC).
8. country: The country where the company is located.
9. funds_raised_millions: The total funds raised by the company in millions of dollars.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:

Data Cleaning:

- Handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and standardize formats.
- Ensure the data is accurate and ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Analyze the cleaned dataset to identify trends and insights.
- Perform various SQL queries to understand the extent and impact of layoffs.

## Methodology
The project involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning

- Data Import: Load the dataset from the CSV file.
- Data Inspection: Examine the data to understand its structure and identify any issues.
- Handling Missing Values: Address any missing or null values in the dataset.
- Data Standardization: Ensure consistency in data formats, such as date and numerical values.
- Data Validation: Perform checks to validate the accuracy and integrity of the data.
- Export Cleaned Data: Save the cleaned dataset for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Data Overview: Review the cleaned dataset to understand its structure and key features.
- Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics to understand the distribution and central tendencies of the data.
- Trend Analysis: Examine trends over time, such as the number of layoffs per month or year.
- Industry Analysis: Analyze layoffs by industry to identify which sectors were most affected.
- Geographical Analysis: Investigate the geographical distribution of layoffs, including by country and location.
- Company Analysis: Identify companies with the highest number of layoffs and those with significant layoff percentages.
- Funding Analysis: Explore the relationship between layoffs and the funding stages or amounts raised by companies.
- Correlation Analysis: Examine correlations between different variables to identify potential relationships and insights.
By following these steps, the EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of the layoff data, revealing important patterns and insights that can inform further analysis and decision-making.

### Benefits
Using Layoff Data Cleaner and Explorer provides several benefits:

- Improved Data Quality: Ensures that the dataset is free from errors and inconsistencies.
- Enhanced Usability: Makes the data easier to use for analysis and decision-making.
- In-depth Insights: Provides comprehensive analysis through EDA to uncover trends and patterns.
- Time Savings: Automates the data cleaning process, saving time and effort for data analysts and researchers.
