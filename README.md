- Clean the Data: Handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and standardize formats.
- Prepare for Analysis: Structure the data in a way that is suitable for analysis and visualization.
- Ensure Accuracy: Verify the accuracy of the data through validation checks.

  ## Methodology
The data cleaning process involves the following steps:

- Data Import: Load the dataset from the CSV file.
- Data Inspection: Examine the data to understand its structure and identify any issues.
- Handling Missing Values: Address any missing or null values in the dataset.
- Data Standardization: Ensure consistency in data formats, such as date and numerical values.
- Data Validation: Perform checks to validate the accuracy and integrity of the data.
- Export Cleaned Data: Save the cleaned dataset for further analysis.
By following these steps, Layoff Data Cleaner transforms the raw dataset into a cleaned and well-structured format, ready for various analytical tasks such as trend analysis, visualization, and reporting.

## Benefits
Using Layoff Data Cleaner provides several benefits:

- Improved Data Quality: Ensures that the dataset is free from errors and inconsistencies.
- Enhanced Usability: Makes the data easier to use for analysis and decision-making.
- Time Savings: Automates the data cleaning process, saving time and effort for data analysts and researchers.
